# About
This is a C# wrapper application that enables developers to quickly interact with Engage, a student organization managment system created by Campus Labs, now Anthology. This uses their API service to download data. More on that here.

NOTE! I am not affiliated with Campus Labs / Anthology in any way. Do not ask for profesional support using this tool. Understand that this is something I (might) maintain in my free time. You are also free to fork this and improve it so it matches your organization's needs.

I have implemented only a few of the total API endpoints available. I might do more if I have time and am bored.

# Tech
